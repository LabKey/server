# IDE Index MCP - Agent Guide

The IDE Index MCP server exposes JetBrains IDE indexing and refactoring capabilities. These tools provide **semantic** code understanding superior to text-based search/replace.

## Core Rule

**Always prefer IDE MCP tools over built-in tools (grep, find, sed, read) for semantic code operations.** IDE tools understand code structure, types, inheritance, and references. Built-in tools only see text.

## When to Use IDE Tools vs Built-In Tools

| Task | Use IDE Tool | Use Built-In Tool |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Find all usages of a method/class/variable | `ide_find_references` | Never - grep misses renamed imports, aliases, overrides |
| Go to a symbol's definition | `ide_find_definition` | Never - grep can't resolve through imports/generics |
| Find a class by name | `ide_find_class` | Only if IDE unavailable |
| Find a file by name | `ide_find_file` | `Glob` is fine for simple patterns |
| Search for a word in code | `ide_search_text` | `Grep` is fine for regex patterns (IDE tool is exact-word only) |
| Rename a symbol across project | `ide_refactor_rename` | Never - sed/replace breaks code |
| Move a file to another directory | `ide_move_file` | Never - mv/git mv bypasses IDE move semantics |
| Check for errors in a file | `ide_diagnostics` | Never - no equivalent |
| Understand class hierarchy | `ide_type_hierarchy` | Never - no equivalent |
| Find who calls a method | `ide_call_hierarchy` | Never - grep misses indirect calls |
| Find interface implementations | `ide_find_implementations` | Never - grep can't resolve type relationships |
| Delete a symbol safely | `ide_refactor_safe_delete` | Never - manual deletion misses usages |
| Find what a method overrides | `ide_find_super_methods` | Never - no equivalent |
| Read file content | Built-in Read tool | `ide_read_file` only for library/jar sources |
| Find text with regex | `Grep` | IDE search_text doesn't support regex |

## Pre-Flight Check

Before using any IDE tool that requires smart mode, check IDE readiness:

```
ide_index_status -> if isDumbMode: true, wait a few seconds and retry
```

Most tools require smart mode (IDE finished indexing). Tools that work in dumb mode: `ide_index_status`, `ide_sync_files`, `ide_reformat_code`, `ide_open_file`, `ide_get_active_file`.

## File Sync Rule

If you created or modified files outside the IDE (via Write/Edit tools) and an IDE search tool returns incomplete/missing results, call `ide_sync_files` first, then retry.

```json
{ "paths": ["src/new_file.java", "src/modified_file.java"] }
```

Omit `paths` to sync the entire project.

## Parameter Rules

1. **Line and column are 1-based** (first line = 1, first column = 1)
2. **Project file paths are relative** to project root (e.g., `src/main/java/App.java`, NOT absolute paths). If an IDE tool returns a dependency/library file, keep the returned absolute path or `jar://` URL unchanged when passing it back to read-only navigation tools or `ide_read_file`
3. **Column must point to the symbol name**, not whitespace or punctuation. For `public void myMethod()`, column should land on `m` of `myMethod`. For dotted expressions like `json.dumps()` or `os.path.join()`, put the column on the member token (`dumps`, `join`) when you want the member definition rather than the module/package.
4. **project_path is only needed** for multi-project workspaces. Omit for single-project setups. When needed, use the absolute path to the project root.
5. **Use built-in search scope intentionally**: `ide_find_references`, `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_type_hierarchy`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_find_class`, `ide_find_file`, and `ide_find_symbol` accept `scope`. Use `project_files` for the default project-only view, `project_and_libraries` when dependency code matters, `project_production_files` to stay out of tests, and `project_test_files` when you want test-only results.

## Tool Selection by Task

### "I need to understand how X is used"
1. `ide_find_references` - all call sites, field accesses, imports
2. `ide_call_hierarchy` with `direction: "callers"` - full call chain upward

### "I need to understand what X is"
1. `ide_find_definition` - jump to source
2. `ide_type_hierarchy` - inheritance chain
3. `ide_find_super_methods` - what interface/base method it implements

### "I need to find a class/file/symbol"
1. `ide_find_class` - classes by name (CamelCase: `USvc` finds `UserService`)
2. `ide_find_file` - files by name
3. `ide_search_text` - exact word occurrences across project

### "I need to refactor"
1. `ide_refactor_rename` - rename symbol + all references atomically
2. `ide_move_file` - move file and let the IDE apply semantic updates when that language/backend supports them
3. `ide_refactor_safe_delete` - delete with usage checking (Java/Kotlin only)
4. `ide_reformat_code` - apply project code style (disabled by default)

### "I need to check for problems"
1. `ide_diagnostics` - compiler errors, warnings, quick fixes

### "I need to find implementations of an interface"
1. `ide_find_implementations` - cursor on interface/abstract class/method

### "I need to trace call chains"
1. `ide_call_hierarchy` with `direction: "callers"` - who calls this?
2. `ide_call_hierarchy` with `direction: "callees"` - what does this call?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using grep instead of `ide_find_references`**: Grep finds text, not semantic usages. Misses aliased imports, includes false positives from comments/strings.

2. **Using sed/replace instead of `ide_refactor_rename`**: Text replacement breaks code. IDE rename updates all references, getters/setters, overrides, test classes, imports.

3. **Using mv/git mv instead of `ide_move_file`**: File system moves bypass IDE move semantics. `ide_move_file` can preserve IDE-managed package/namespace/reference updates when the active language backend supports them.

4. **Forgetting to check index status**: If IDE is indexing (dumb mode), most tools error. Check `ide_index_status` first if a tool fails unexpectedly.

5. **Using 0-based line/column**: All IDE tools use **1-based**. Line 5 in file = `line: 5`.

6. **Passing absolute project file paths**: Use relative paths for project files. `src/main/App.java`, not `/Users/me/project/src/main/App.java`.

7. **Rewriting plugin-returned library paths**: If a search or read tool returns an absolute path or `jar://` URL for a dependency/library file, pass that path back unchanged to read-only navigation tools or `ide_read_file`.

8. **Not syncing after external file changes**: After creating files via Write tool, call `ide_sync_files` before searching.

9. **Using `ide_search_text` for regex**: This tool is exact-word only (uses word index). Use `Grep` for regex.

10. **Using `ide_find_class` for methods/functions**: It searches classes only. Use `ide_search_text` for a quick word lookup.

## Disabled-by-Default Tools

These tools exist but are disabled by default. If you get "tool not found", they need to be enabled in IDE settings (Settings > Tools > Index MCP Server):

`ide_build_project`, `ide_file_structure`, `ide_find_symbol`, `ide_read_file`, `ide_get_active_file`, `ide_open_file`, `ide_reformat_code`
